## Overview

This repository contains the code for the paper **"Adversarially Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection Using Lyapunov-Stabilized Embeddings"**. The method, termed **AROS**, employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) with Lyapunov stability to create robust embeddings for OOD detection, significantly improving performance against adversarial attacks.

The method, termed **AROS**, employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) with Lyapunov stability to create robust embeddings for OOD detection, significantly improving performance against adversarial attacks. Additionally, the repository includes two notebooks: one demonstrates the training and evaluation process on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, while the other focuses on the ablation study.

## Preprint

Check out our preprint now out on arXiv! [Adversarially Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection Using Lyapunov-Stabilized Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10744). Hossein Mirzaeri & Mackenzie W. Mathis. Oct 2024.

 
## Key Features

- **Lyapunov Stability for OOD Detection**: Ensures that perturbed inputs converge back to stable equilibrium points, improving robustness against adversarial attacks.
- **Fake Embedding Crafting Strategy**: Generates fake OOD embeddings by sampling from the low-likelihood regions of the ID data feature space, eliminating the need for additional OOD datasets.
- **Orthogonal Binary Layer**: Enhances separation between ID and OOD embeddings, further improving robustness.

## Demo 

- [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/AROS/blob/main/Notebooks/AROS.ipynb) This notebook is designed to replicate and analyze the results presented in Table 1 of the AROS paper, focusing on out-of-distribution detection performance under both attack scenarios and clean evaluation.
- [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/AROS/blob/main/Notebooks/Ablation_Study.ipynb) This notebook is designed to demo the ablation study.
