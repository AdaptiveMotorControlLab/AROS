        "This notebook is designed to replicate and analyze the results presented in Table 1 of the AROS paper, focusing on out-of-distribution detection performance under both attack scenarios and clean evaluation. The dataset configurations involve using CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. The notebook is structured to load a pre-trained model as the encoder, followed by generating fake OOD embeddings through sampling. The model is then trained using the designed loss function and evaluated across various OOD detection benchmarks to assess its performance under different conditions.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
